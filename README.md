The brain might be free, but it's best to back things up

<Info> This repository contains my notes, research, experimental notes and, if I am bored enough, all the useless stuff I gather.

If you want to know more about the subject, do follow the resources I will be leaving in the references section or drop me a message if you spot something wrong.
Note! I am a university student, thus, I might have access to some academic papers more easily. Therefore, you might not have access to them (as they are usually behind a paywall). I will not upload any PDFs or books here as I do not want to infringe any rights!
